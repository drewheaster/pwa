# JATE App

Welcome to the last note taking app you'll ever need! 

To get started, make sure we run "npm install" in the terminal. Once we do this, we can access the local website by running "npm start".

While you're in the web app, you can write down anything and everything your heart desires!

If you'd like, you may take your writings offline by clicking the "Install" button on the home page! This will allow you to use the app directly from your desktop!

To check out the website for yourself, visit this [link](https://pwa-4bko.onrender.com)!

Happy coding!
